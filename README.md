# Custom Components

This project provides React components that needed to be developed without using external libraries.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jardelmontan/react-custom-components.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

Each component has a page used for viewing, testing, and parameter settings.

To view the component's example page, simply access the route with the same name as the component. For example, for data-table we must access the **/data-table** route.
