# Custom Components

This project has custom components without external dependencies. They serve as a base to improve or use with some internal design system.

   git clone https://github.com/jardelmontan/react-custom-components.git
   ```

### Usage

Each component has a page used for viewing, testing, and parameter settings.

To view the component's example page, simply access the route with the same name as the component. For example, for data-table we must access the **/data-table** route.
